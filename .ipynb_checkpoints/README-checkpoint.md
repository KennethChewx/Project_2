# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

**Problem Statement**
We look at predicting housing sale prices in Ames from a matrix of 79 features provided in the dataset.

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Are missing values imputed appropriately?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?
- Does the student address whether or not they are likely to be able to answer their problem statement with the provided data given what they've discovered during EDA?

**Preprocessing and Modeling**
- Are categorical variables one-hot encoded?
- Does the student investigate or manufacture features with linear relationships to the target?
- Have the data been scaled appropriately?
- Does the student properly split and/or sample the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student utilize feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of models to identify a production algorithm (**AT MINIMUM:** linear regression, lasso, and ridge)?
- Does the student defend their choice of production model relevant to the data at hand and the problem?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

**Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding**
- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective?
- Is more than one metric utilized in order to better assess performance?
- Does the student interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?
- Is domain knowledge demonstrated when interpreting results?
- Does the student provide appropriate interpretation with regards to descriptive and inferential statistics?

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- Does the student provide appropriate context to connect individual steps back to the overall project?
- Is it clear how the final recommendations were reached?
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?
- Does the conclusion answer the original problem statement?
- Does the student address how findings of this research can be applied for the benefit of stakeholders?
- Are future steps to move the project forward identified?

### Organization and Professionalism

**Project Organization**
- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Are data imported/saved using relative paths?

**Visualizations**
- Are sufficient visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Are plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

**Python Syntax and Control Flow**
- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?
- Are Pandas functions used appropriately?
- Are `sklearn` methods used appropriately?

**Presentation**
- Is the problem statement clearly presented?
- Does a strong narrative run through the presentation building toward a final conclusion?
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?
- Is the level of technicality appropriate for the intended audience?
- Is the student substantially over or under time?
- Does the student appropriately pace their presentation?
- Does the student deliver their message with clarity and volume?
- Are appropriate visualizations generated for the intended audience?
- Are visualizations necessary and useful for supporting conclusions/explaining findings?

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they end up failing. While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll be prepared to succeed in the workforce**.
